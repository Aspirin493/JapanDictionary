# JapanDictionary
A Windows program to help you translate Japanese words, phrases and slang using the jardic dictionary.

This is a small Windows program written in C#. It will help you a lot in learning Japanese, translating words and slang. 

I will be happy to look at it and take any pull requests if needed. 

The program uses Guna and Siticone libraries for GUI and Costura.Fody.
